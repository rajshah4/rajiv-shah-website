        "# Understanding Sparse Matrices through Interactive Visualizations\n",
        "\n",
        "When working with machine learning models, preparing data properly is\n",
        "essential. One common preprocessing technique is one-hot encoding, which\n",
        "transforms categorical data into a format algorithms can understand.\n",
        "However, this transformation often creates sparse matrices - dataframes\n",
        "where most values are zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Basic One-Hot Encoding\n",
        "\n",
        "The first animation illustrates the fundamental concept of one-hot\n",
        "encoding. This transformation converts a single categorical column (like\n",
        "“city”) into multiple binary columns, where each column represents one\n",
        "possible category value.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  Starting with the original dataset containing categorical values\n",
        "2.  Adding binary indicator columns for each category\n",
        "3.  Showing how the dataset becomes wider but sparse (mostly filled with\n",
        "    zeros)\n",
        "4.  Demonstrating how the original categorical column becomes redundant\n",
        "\n",
        "In traditional tabular data processing, we often don’t see this sparsity\n",
        "visually. The animation makes it clear how one-hot encoding dramatically\n",

        "## The Curse of Dimensionality\n",
        "\n",
        "The second animation takes the concept further by demonstrating what\n",
        "happens with high-cardinality categorical features - those with many\n",

        "2.  Expanding to over 150 columns when encoding a categorical feature\n",

        "\n",
        "Understanding the sparsity that results from one-hot encoding is crucial\n",
        "for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Memory usage**: Sparse matrices can consume excessive memory if\n",
        "    not properly handled\n",
        "-   **Computational efficiency**: Processing mostly-zero matrices is\n",
        "    inefficient\n",
        "-   **Model performance**: Many algorithms struggle with extremely\n",
        "    sparse data\n",
        "-   **Feature selection**: With hundreds of binary columns, feature\n",
        "    selection becomes critical\n",
        "\n",
        "For high-cardinality features, consider alternatives like feature\n",
        "hashing, target encoding, or embeddings to avoid the dimensionality\n",
        "explosion shown in the second animation.\n",
        "\n",
        "These visualizations help build intuition about what’s happening “under\n",
        "the hood” when we preprocess data - something that’s often hidden when\n",
        "we use high-level libraries that handle these transformations\n",
        "automatically.\n",
